how to make your own wallet version:
- make changes in ./whitelabel.js and package.json (optional)
- change app icons in ./app-assets
- modify ./mobile-config, change app specific info and add an explorer to the list of allowed external urls
- modify app title ./client/main.html
- add coin icon in ./public/images
- (optional) make necessary changes in ./client/styles/whitelabel.scss if you need alternative styling/theming

note: current whitelabel version is locked to work with only one coin at a time
